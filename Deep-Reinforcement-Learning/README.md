# ðŸš€ Deep Q-Learning for Lunar Lander

This project implements a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** to train an agent to land a lunar module safely in the OpenAI Gym environment.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Use reinforcement learning to solve a control problem.
- Implement Q-learning with a neural network as a function approximator.

---

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture
- Input: 8 continuous state variables (position, velocity, angle, etc.)
- Output: Q-values for 4 discrete actions.
- Hidden Layers: 2 fully connected layers (ReLU activation)

---

## ðŸ§© Results
The agent successfully learns to land with an average score > 200 after ~500 episodes.

---

## ðŸ“Š Libraries
- Python  
- PyTorch  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- OpenAI Gym

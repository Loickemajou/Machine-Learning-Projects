### ü´Å Pneumonia Classification using ResNet-50
A deep learning project that uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Built entirely in **PyTorch**, this notebook demonstrates how image data can be leveraged for medical diagnosis and healthcare insights. **Class Activation Maps (CAMs)** are used to visualize regions in the X-rays that influence the model's predictions.

---

### Overview
The notebook  walks through a complete image classification pipeline for medical imaging. It reads chest X-ray images, preprocesses and augments the data, and trains a **ResNet-50** model to classify images as **Pneumonia** or **Normal**.

---

### Project Workflow

**Data Loading**  
- Loads a dataset of chest X-ray images labeled as `Normal` or `Pneumonia`.

**Image Preprocessing & Augmentation**  
- Resizes images, normalizes pixel values, and applies augmentations (rotation, flips, etc.) to increase model robustness.

**Label Encoding**  
- Converts categorical labels into numeric form suitable for binary classification.

**Model Building**  
- Fine-tunes a **ResNet-50** architecture with pretrained weights from ImageNet.  
- Adds custom dense layers for binary classification.

**Training & Evaluation**  
- Trains the model on the prepared dataset.  
- Evaluates performance using metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  
- Generates predictions and visualizes results on sample X-rays.  
- Uses **Class Activation Maps (CAMs)** to highlight regions of the X-ray that influenced the model's decision.

### Objective
The goal of this project is to provide an automated tool for detecting pneumonia from chest X-rays. Such systems can support radiologists and healthcare providers by offering faster, data-driven diagnostic insights, while CAMs help explain model decisions.

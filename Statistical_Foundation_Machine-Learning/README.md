# üìä Statistical Foundations of Machine Learning ‚Äî Final Project

This project explores fundamental questions in **machine learning theory and practice** through three experimental studies.
It aims to understand how data quality and model choice affect learning behavior and performance.

## üîç Research Questions

1. **Impact of Mislabeled Data and Outliers**

   * Investigates how noisy or mislabeled samples influence regression model accuracy.
   * Compares models trained on clean vs. contaminated datasets.

2. **Ensemble Methods vs. Single Models**

   * Examines how **bagging** and **boosting** techniques reduce overfitting compared to single learners.
   * Evaluates performance improvements using ensemble averaging.

3. **SVM Sensitivity to Data Characteristics**

   * Studies how **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** react to class overlap, class imbalance, and label noise.
   * Analyzes how these factors change the number and location of support vectors.

## üß† Key Takeaways

* Data quality significantly affects model generalization.
* Ensemble methods (especially boosting) improve robustness against overfitting.
* SVM decision boundaries are sensitive to class distribution and labeling accuracy.
